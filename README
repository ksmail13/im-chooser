IM Chooser
=============
IM Chooser is a GUI configuration tool for Input Method to
choose the Input Method to be used or disable Input Method
usage on the desktop.

How does IM Chooser work?
============================
IM Chooser relies on xinput.sh script that you may need to
install it onto the proper place where your system provides
a hook to bring something up during X server is starting,
such as /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d on Fedora and
/etc/X11/Xsession.d on Debian.
For XIM servers, you will have to provide symlinks for them
with ll_CC style of locale on /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d by
default (it's configurable with --with-xinputdir option). if
your system has alternatives system, it might stands to do
so.  Also, you can drop the improper XIM servers from the
selection list if you specify --with-xinput-suffix and no
such suffix is given to the xinput script of XIM servers,
because im-chooser tries to pick up the xinput script with
the name + --with-xinput-suffix. therefore "xim" xinput
script provided by this displays the proper XIM servers for
your language then.

What variables are available for the IM specific configuration?
==================================================================
XIM
	For settings of XIM. actually it will be used like
	XMODIFIERS=@im=$XIM.

XIM_PROGRAM
	A XIM server be brought up to communicate through
	XIM protocol. XIM_ARGS can be used to give any
	options for XIM_PROGRAM.

GTK_IM_MODULE
	For GTK+ immodule.

QT_IM_MODULE
	For Qt immodule.

IMSETTINGS_IGNORE_ME
	For something like that it shouldn't be chosen
	directly but another one can handle it. if this
	appears in IM specific configuration, IM Chooser
	just ignore it and hide it from the custom choices.

AUXILIARY_PROGRAM
	an optional program that may want to bring up for
	IM. AUXILIARY_ARGS can be used to give any options
	for AUXLIARY_PROGRAM.

PREFERENCE_PROGRAM
	an optional program that sets up the input method.
	This program will be brought up from im-chooser.
	PREFERENCE_ARGS can be used to give any options for
	PREFERENCE_PROGRAM.

SHORT_DESC
	an optional short description to explain the input method.
	This variable is particularly used to display the input method
	name at the input method selection list. otherwise XIM variable
	will be used for that.

LONG_DESC
	an optional long description to explain the input method.
	This variable isn't actually used yet.
