IM Chooser
=============
IM Chooser is a GUI configuration tool for Input Method to
choose the Input Method to be used or disable Input Method
usage on the desktop.

How does IM Chooser work?
============================
IM Chooser relies on xinput.sh script that you may need to
install it onto the proper place where your system provides
a hook to bring something up during X server is starting,
such as /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d on Fedora Core and
/etc/X11/Xsession.d on Debian.
For XIM servers, you will have to provide symlinks for them
with ll_CC style of locale on /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d by
default (it's configurable with --with-xinputdir option). if
your system has alternatives system, it might stands to do
so.

What variables are available for the IM specific configuration?
==================================================================
XIM
	For settings of XIM. actually it will be used like
	XMODIFIERS=@im=$XIM.

GTK_IM_MODULE
	For GTK+ immodule.

QT_IM_MODULE
	For Qt immodule.

IM_CHOOSER_IGNORE_ME
	For something like that it shouldn't be chosen
	directly but another one can handle it. if this
	appears in IM specific configuration, IM Chooser
	just ignore it and hide it from the custom choices.
